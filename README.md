## My process

1. Wrote the HTML
2. Updated font properties
3. Added padding, borders, and margins
4. Added shadows
4. Added background/text colors
5. Added hover properties
6. Added horizontal alignment
7. Added "vertical alignment"

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned that I still struggle with alignment to the center. In my last project (QR Code), I also struggled with alignment to the center. So, for this Blog Preview Card project, I decided to align the card last, after finishing the rest of the CSS (see "My Process"). This proved to be a bad idea. I got a very helpful comment on my QR Code project showing me how to use flexbox to align the card to the center. I should have done this first, before adding any other CSS, because I was unable to use it to align the card after I finished the rest of the CSS. I tried to apply it to the body, but it did not work. I ended up using display:table and margin:auto for horizontal alignment, and transform for "vertical alignment" (which doesn't actually vertically align, just moves it to a specific position vertically).

### Continued development

After I submit this project, I will practice center alignment specifically until I get really good at it.
