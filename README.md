## Overview

This is a blog preview card created with HTML and CSS. It is my second solution for this project, one in which the centering issues from the first solution are solved. Credit to @FazeenIjaz on Frontend Mentor for explaining to me that I need a container class for flexbox to work properly!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

1. Wrote the HTML (including a "container" class for the body content)
2. Updated font properties
3. Added padding, borders, and margins
4. Added background/text colors
5. Added alignment to the center of the page using flexbox (THANK YOU @FazeenIjaz on Frontend Mentor)
6. Added hover properties

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned that in order for flexbox to work properly, the contents of the card must be stored in a container.
